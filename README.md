# Disastroid

A one-stop solution to avoid getting caught in disasters.

## Features

* Remote monitoring of disaster and relief response.

* Automated suggestions of healthcare centres/police stations to triage relief from.

* SMS alerts to victims in the area with directions to the nearest relief centre.

* Monitoring of hospitals in the area.

* Heatmap generation with the location of victims in the region to direct response.

* Citizens in case of a disaster can send SMS's to the authority. This SMS stream will be monitored and keyword clustering will be carried out to initiate a response. 

* Facial recognition to hand out relief. Photos of victims to be taken at the centre. Facial recognition will determine if relief has already been handed out to a particular individual at the centre.

* The families can search for their relatives by just uploading their photos.
